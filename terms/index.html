    <h3 id="iv-data-for-booking-mediation">(iv) Data for booking mediation</h3>
    <p>Beyond publicly accessible data the linguatrip.com requires additional data from student / guests and service providers during the registration process, which are necessary for booking mediation. This data should contain a full name, street address, e-mail address, phone number etc. During the registration process the linguatrip.com informs service providers and student / guests that this data will be passed on to the opposite contract party in the case of a successful booking mediation.</p>
    <p>According to the terms of use, if the service providers foresee the transmission of the student / guest's credit card details, the linguatrip.com will transfer this data to the service provider. The service provider can charge the student / guest's credit card with an amount determined by the terms of use in the case of a no show (student / guest does not arrive). The linguatrip.com passes credit card data on to only authorized VISA and MASTERCARD partners. The linguatrip.com is not responsible for the legitimate use of the credit card data by the service provider.</p>
    <p>Students' details are send in an archive that is protected by password. The password is obtained by the service provider during registration process on linguatrip.com and it is service provider’s responsibility to keep it safe and secure.</p>
    <h3 id="v-reliability-of-the-transmitted-data">(v) Reliability of the transmitted data</h3>
    <p>The service provider assures that all information transmitted to the linguatrip.com is correct. This applies particularly to the uploaded content and photographs. The service provider confirms that these photographs give a realistic impression of the service profile. This means, particularly but not exclusively, that a realistic appearance of the contracting persons is clearly discernible in the photographs. Any violation of this rule will cause the prompt deletion of the respective profile, and the immediate termination of the contract with the service provider by the linguatrip.com.</p>
    <h3 id="vi-translation-of-data">(vi) Translation of data</h3>
    <p>The linguatrip.com reserves the right to translate any collected data (interests of student / guests and service providers, service scope, etc.) into the languages in which linguatrip.com is available.</p>
    <h3 id="vii-usage-of-contact-data-by-the-mpreservercom">(vii) Usage of contact data by the linguatrip.com</h3>

    <h2 id="9-facebook">9. Facebook</h2>
    <p>Our website uses the sign-up and log-in function and social plug-ins of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Face Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. If you have your normal place of residence in the European Union, the Facebook services are offered to you by Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Ireland. The social plug-ins are discernible by the Facebook logos (white “f” on blue background or the characteristic Facebook thumb) or marked by the addition “Facebook Social Plug-In”; all Facebook plug-ins can be viewed here. The sign-up and/or log-in of Facebook is also easy to recognize by the characteristic white script on a blue background.</p>
    <h3 id="i-social-plug-ins">(i) Social Plug-ins</h3>
    <p>
        When you call up a website of ours on which a social plug-in (like button) is implemented, your browser will then establish a direct link to Facebook and will then transmit the following data to Facebook directly:
        o date and time of your visit,
        o the Internet address/URL of the site that you are currently visiting,
        o your IP address,

        o if you click on the plug-in, of course the information that you have used this specific plug-in.
    </p>
    <p>Facebook saves these data for a period of 90 days. Facebook then removes the name and all other personal information from the data; a pseudonymized usage profile remains.</p>
    <p>We explicitly make reference to the fact that we ourselves do not have any influence on the scope of the data which Facebook collects with the help of the plug-in and that with regard to data protection we have to rely on the data usage guideline of Facebook, on which our aforementioned information is based. Please inform yourself further on Facebook specifically about the purpose and scope of the data collection and your rights in this regard and the setting options to protect your privacy using the data usage guidelines.</p>
    <p>However, it is of course possible to prevent the placing of cookies by settings in your browser. In addition, it is also possible to block the social plug-ins of Facebook with add-ons for your browser. For instance with the “Facebook Blocker”</p>
    <h3 id="ii-sign-up-login">(ii) Sign up, login</h3>

    <h2 id="11-liability">11. Liability</h2>
    <p>Services offered on the websites of the linguatrip.com will be provided by third party service members. The linguatrip.com does not offer or provide its own accommodation or services except for the booking mediation between students / guests and service providers. The linguatrip.com is not liable for the correctness of the information given by students / guests and service providers. Furthermore the linguatrip.com is not liable if the service provider does not fulfill its duties derived from its terms of use, or if the students / guest is not satisfied with the service provider's performance for any other reason.</p>
    <p>In the context of its booking mediation service the linguatrip.com is liable without restriction for damage caused in a willful or grossly negligent manner by linguatrip.com, its employees and vicarious agents and in the malicious concealment of deficits, with the explicit assumption of warranty and for damage arising from injury to life, body and health.</p>
    <p>linguatrip.com is only liable for other damage if an obligation is breached whose fulfillment makes the orderly implementation of the contract possible in the first place and whose compliance the contracting partner may regularly trust in (cardinal obligation). The compensation obligation is restricted to damage that can be seen as typical of the contract and foreseeable. Any liability pursuant to the product liability law remains unaffected. A liability of linguatrip.com that goes beyond the aforementioned is excluded.</p>
    <p>The amount of liability is limited to the typically foreseeable damages at the time of the conclusion of the contract. This limitation is not valid for the intentional or negligent breach of duty by the linguatrip.com, or by a legal or affiliated agent of the linguatrip.com.</p>
    <p>Liability for indirect damages, particularly loss of profit, exists only in the case of intentional or negligent breach of duty by a legal or affiliated agent of the linguatrip.com.</p>

    <h2 id="12-final-provisions">12. Final provisions</h2>
    <p>The law of the Russian Federation applies. </p>
    <p>If the service provider is a merchant, legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, the sole place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this agreement is St.Petersburg. The same applies if the user does not have any general place of jurisdiction or place of residence in the Russian Federation or the usual domicile is not known at the time the legal action is filed.</p>
    <p>If individual provisions of the agreement with the user, including this provision, should be or become invalid in their entirety or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The same applies in the event of a lacuna.</p>
    <h2 id="13-severability">13. Severability</h2>
    <p>If one or more provisions of this agreement should be or become invalid or un- enforceable, the balance of the agreement shall remain unaffected, thereby remaining in full force and effect. In this event, the parties shall substitute the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid one which as closely as possible achieves the economic purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.</p>
